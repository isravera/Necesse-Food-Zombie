**Craving a little more... *flavor* in your [Necesse](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1169040/Necesse/) experience?**

The Food Zombie mod adds a new, hungry enemy to the game! These shambling undead crave a taste of your delicious loot, and they're willing to fight for it.

*This mod was created as a learning project to explore the world of Necesse modding, and I hope you enjoy the result!*

**Here's what you can expect:**

* **Food-obsessed foe:** The Food Zombie is a new hostile NPC that drops food upon defeat.
* **Gourmet Meals:**  The Food Zombie's palate is refined, so you might find yourself fighting for your precious gourmet meals, coffee, and even cappuccinos!
* **Feed your Settlers:**  Make feeding your settlers a little easier with this new source of food!
